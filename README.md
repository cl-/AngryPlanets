Angry Planets
==============

Our goal is to help children learn about the effects of gravity, and the planets and moons, through a visual game.

The game allows children to see what exactly happens when planets and bodies interact with each other when gravity is taken into consideration:
- when a planet of the correct gravity is inserted into the space, the moons orbit normally. As a congratulatory message, the sun glows bright.
- when a planet with too much gravity is inserted, the moons crash into the planet.
- when a planet with too little gravity is inserted, the moons fly off into space because there's not enough pull.

The other goal would be for scientists to be able to easily teach new content, by making it easy for them to create new stages for new planets and revolving bodies through simply submitting a text file input of raw data.
